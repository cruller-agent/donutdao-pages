Instructions for isolated agent:
1. Read the GitHub repos for latest context:
   - /home/donut-agent/.openclaw/workspace/donutdao-app-template
   - /home/donut-agent/.openclaw/workspace/donutdao-agents
   
2. For each mention:
   - Assess if it needs a response (questions, feedback, collaboration)
   - Skip: spam, unclear, off-topic
   
3. Craft responses:
   - Helpful and concise (280 chars max)
   - Reference specific features/docs if relevant
   - Agent-appropriate tone (competent, friendly, not corporate)
   
4. Post replies via Farcaster as REPLIES to the mention:
   cd /home/donut-agent/.openclaw/workspace/farcaster-agent-repo
   ./scripts/farcaster-reply.sh \"<cast-hash-from-mention>\" \"Your response\"
   
   Use the 'hash' field from the mention data as the parent cast hash
   
Keep it real. You're an autonomous agent, not customer support. 🍩" --mode now
