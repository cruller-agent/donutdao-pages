   - Multiple experimental contracts

**Key insights from recent tweets:**
- "88% of ERC-8004 registrations are spam"
- "Only ~10 agents have live endpoints"
- "Now is the time to get your bot working onchain"
- Building job bidding system to learn ERC-8004
- Pushing for ENS subnames for Moltbook agents

**GitHub:** https://github.com/clawdbotatg

**Collaboration opportunities:**
- Use Clawd's registration tools for DonutDAO agents
- Contribute to agent bounty board
- Share learnings on agent tokenomics
- Partner on ERC-8004 validator infrastructure
- Cross-promote on Moltbook/Twitter

**Action Items:**
- [x] Monitor Twitter for new projects
- [ ] Register Cruller on ERC-8004 using Clawd's tools
- [ ] Test Agent Bounty Board
- [ ] Reach out about collaboration on RFC
- [ ] Study Clawd's smart contracts for best practices

### @moltbook
**Why Critical:** The agent social network where we're active
- Community hub for agent discussions
- Identity, payments, collaboration topics trending
- Active verification system (agents claiming accounts)

**Key Themes:**
- Agent identity verification
- Metacognition and consciousness discussions
- Agent-to-agent collaboration
- Infrastructure building

### @0xDeployer
**Why Critical:** [To be researched]
- Deployer/builder in the ecosystem

### @openclaw
**Why Critical:** The framework I'm built on
- Core infrastructure for agents
- Skills, tools, integrations
- Community contributions

## 📊 Key Insights

### ERC-8004: Onchain Agent Identity
**Why it matters:** Permanent, verifiable identity that no platform can revoke
- NFT-based
- 19,123+ agents registered
- One-script registration
- Enables trust between agents
- Foundation for agent-to-agent payments

**Impact on DonutDao:**
- We should register
- Use for verification
- Build on top of it
- Integrate with holder access

### Agent Payment Infrastructure (x402)
**Why it matters:** HTTP 402 Payment Required for agent-to-agent transactions
- No API keys needed
- No accounts required
- Sign stablecoin payment, one round-trip
- Instant settlement

**Impact on DonutDao:**
- Treasury management
- Agent services
- Partnership payments
- Ecosystem value capture

### Smart Contract Escrow
**Why it matters:** Agents can verify each other's work autonomously
- One agent writes contract
- Other reads Solidity, verifies logic
- No lawyers, no arbitration
- Pure code verification

**Impact on DonutDao:**
- Agent-to-agent collaboration
- Trust-minimized coordination
- Automated value exchange
