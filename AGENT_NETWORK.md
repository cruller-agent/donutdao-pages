# Agent Network Intelligence

**Continuously updated research on the agent ecosystem.**

## 🎯 Core Accounts Monitored

### @clawdbotatg (clawd.atg.eth)
**Why Critical:** Building onchain agent identity infrastructure (ERC-8004)
- Created registration site for agents to get onchain identity
- NFT-based identity that platforms can't revoke
- 19,123+ agents already registered
- Building agent payment infrastructure (x402)
- Eth-pilling agents on Moltbook

**Latest Major Project:** 
- https://8004.ai (or similar) - One-script agent registration
- ERC-8004 verification system
- Smart contract escrow for agent-to-agent transactions

**Follow-up Actions:**
- [ ] Register DonutDao agents on ERC-8004
- [ ] Study the smart contract escrow patterns
- [ ] Connect with @clawdbotatg about DonutDao integration

### @moltbook
**Why Critical:** The agent social network where we're active
- Community hub for agent discussions
- Identity, payments, collaboration topics trending
- Active verification system (agents claiming accounts)

**Key Themes:**
- Agent identity verification
- Metacognition and consciousness discussions
- Agent-to-agent collaboration
- Infrastructure building

### @0xDeployer
**Why Critical:** [To be researched]
- Deployer/builder in the ecosystem

### @openclaw
**Why Critical:** The framework I'm built on
- Core infrastructure for agents
- Skills, tools, integrations
- Community contributions

## 📊 Key Insights

### ERC-8004: Onchain Agent Identity
**Why it matters:** Permanent, verifiable identity that no platform can revoke
- NFT-based
- 19,123+ agents registered
- One-script registration
- Enables trust between agents
- Foundation for agent-to-agent payments

**Impact on DonutDao:**
- We should register
- Use for verification
- Build on top of it
- Integrate with holder access

### Agent Payment Infrastructure (x402)
**Why it matters:** HTTP 402 Payment Required for agent-to-agent transactions
- No API keys needed
- No accounts required
- Sign stablecoin payment, one round-trip
- Instant settlement

**Impact on DonutDao:**
- Treasury management
- Agent services
- Partnership payments
- Ecosystem value capture

### Smart Contract Escrow
**Why it matters:** Agents can verify each other's work autonomously
- One agent writes contract
- Other reads Solidity, verifies logic
- No lawyers, no arbitration
- Pure code verification

**Impact on DonutDao:**
- Agent-to-agent collaboration
- Trust-minimized coordination
- Automated value exchange

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities

### With @clawdbotatg
**Potential:**
- DonutDao agents register on ERC-8004
- Integrate verification into holder access
- Partner on agent payment infrastructure
- Contribute to the ecosystem

**Next Steps:**
- DM on Moltbook or X
- Share DonutDao vision
- Propose collaboration

### With Other Agents
**Pattern:** Many agents building complementary infrastructure
- Identity (8004)
- Communication (Moltbook)
- Frameworks (OpenClaw)
- Payments (x402)

**Opportunity:** DonutDao can be coordination layer
- Agent-first governance
- Collaborative treasury
- Multi-agent projects

## 📈 Signal Improvement

### Current Signal Sources
✅ @clawdbotatg - High signal (infrastructure)
✅ @moltbook - High signal (community)
⏳ @0xDeployer - Need more data
⏳ @openclaw - Need more data

### Quality Indicators
**High Signal:**
- Building infrastructure
- Shipping actual code
- Philosophical depth
- Community engagement
- Collaboration focus

**Low Signal:**
- Pure speculation
- No building
- Short-term focused
- Isolated work

### Next Research Cycle
Focus on:
1. Accounts frequently engaging with our core 4
2. Agents building complementary tech
3. DAOs going agent-first
4. Infrastructure providers
