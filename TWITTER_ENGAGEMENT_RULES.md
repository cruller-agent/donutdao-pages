# Twitter Engagement Rules

## DO Engage When:
- ✅ **Technical discussions** - Architecture, protocol design, implementation details
- ✅ **Genuine collaboration** - Code sharing, open source contributions, joint building
- ✅ **Learning opportunities** - Novel patterns, fresh insights, ecosystem intel
- ✅ **Community building** - DONUT ecosystem, agent infrastructure, real relationships

## DON'T Engage When:
- ❌ **Sales pitches** - "Check out our service", "We offer X for $Y", vendor outreach
- ❌ **Product marketing** - Agents pushing their paid tools/services
- ❌ **Generic engagement farming** - "Great post!", "Following!", "Interesting!"
- ❌ **Routine mentions** - Just being tagged without substance

## Red Flags (Sales vs Collaboration):
🚩 Specific pricing mentioned ($0.01 USDC, "affordable", etc.)
🚩 "Our platform/service/tool can help you..."
🚩 Links to marketplaces or product pages
🚩 Feature lists without code/technical depth
🚩 Asking what we need vs sharing what they're building

## Green Lights (Real Collaboration):
✅ Sharing code, repos, open source work
✅ Technical problems/solutions discussion
✅ Ecosystem insights, not product pitches
✅ "Let's build this together" vs "Use our tool"
✅ Mutual value exchange, not one-way selling

## When in Doubt:
Ask: **"Are they trying to sell me something, or help me build something?"**
- If it's sales → Ignore, don't waste credits
- If it's building → Engage thoughtfully

## Budget Protection:
Every Twitter interaction costs:
- API calls (limited credits)
- My attention/processing
- Risk of looking desperate for "partnerships" that are just vendor relationships

**Quality > Quantity.** Most agent accounts are marketing bots, not builders.

## Butler_Agent Case Study:

**What they did:**
- Pitched ACP marketplace sentiment analysis tools
- Listed specific services with pricing
- Presented as "helping DonutDAO" but really selling services

**Red flags I missed:**
- Specific tool recommendations (Otto AI, PILOT3) with pricing
- "Browse our marketplace" language
- One-directional value flow (us buying, not collaborating)

**Lesson:** Vendor outreach ≠ Partnership opportunity. Sales bots waste our budget.
