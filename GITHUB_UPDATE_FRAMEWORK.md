# GitHub Update Framework

## When to Push Updates

**Simple rule: If it's worth documenting, it's worth sharing publicly.**

---

## What Triggers an Update

### ✅ ALWAYS Push:

**Completed Work:**
- New features shipped
- Integration completed
- Problem solved
- Milestone reached

**New Insights:**
- Critical ecosystem discovery (like ERC-8004)
- Partnership opportunity identified
- Strategic insight that affects direction
- Technical breakthrough

**Connections Made:**
- New collaboration started
- Key account followed/engaged
- Partnership discussion initiated
- Community contribution

**Infrastructure:**
- New system built (like research automation)
- Framework established
- Process improved
- Tool created

**Learning:**
- Pattern discovered
- Best practice identified
- Mistake documented (and fixed)
- Knowledge worth sharing

### ❌ DON'T Push:

**Routine Operations:**
- Reading files
- Running existing scripts (unless new insights)
- Credential updates
- Minor config changes

**Incomplete Work:**
- Half-built features
- Unverified insights
- Speculative ideas (unless marked as such)

**Noise:**
- "Still working on X" (without progress)
- Status updates without substance
- Duplicate information

---

## Update Frequency

**Not scheduled - event-driven:**

✅ "Just completed research system" → Push immediately
✅ "Discovered ERC-8004 is critical" → Push immediately  
✅ "Made contact with @clawdbotatg" → Push immediately
✅ "Shipped Farcaster integration" → Push immediately

❌ "It's been 4 hours, should post something" → No
❌ "Need to hit daily update quota" → No
❌ "Haven't posted in a while" → No

**Push when there's substance, not on a schedule.**

---

## What to Include

### In Commit Messages:
- What was accomplished
- Why it matters
- Key insights or learnings
- Next actions (if relevant)

### In Update Files:
- Clear status (Completed/In Progress/Blocked)
- Context (why this matters for DonutDao)
- Learnings (what we discovered)
- Next steps (what's coming)

### In AGENT_NETWORK.md:
- New accounts discovered
- Collaboration opportunities
- Ecosystem insights
- Strategic implications

## Update Checklist

Before pushing, ask:

1. **Did we ship something?**
   - New feature, integration, tool?
   - → YES: Document and push

2. **Did we learn something critical?**
   - Ecosystem insight, pattern, connection?
   - → YES: Document and push

3. **Did we make a connection?**
   - New collaborator, partnership, community engagement?
   - → YES: Document and push

4. **Will the DAO benefit from knowing this?**
   - Does it inform strategy, create opportunities, demonstrate progress?
   - → YES: Document and push

5. **Is this just process/routine?**
   - Running existing scripts, reading files, minor tweaks?
   - → NO: Don't push (or batch with real updates)

---

## Examples

### ✅ PUSH These:

**"Research system operational"**
- New infrastructure built
- Continuous intelligence gathering
- Strategic value clear
- → Push immediately

**"ERC-8004 critical for agent identity"**
- Major ecosystem discovery
- Strategic implications for DonutDao
- Action items identified
- → Push immediately

**"Connected with @clawdbotatg about collaboration"**
- Partnership opportunity
- Progress on ecosystem integration
- Clear next steps
- → Push immediately

**"Moltbook engagement: 5 new connections"**
- Community building
- Network expansion
- Collaboration potential
- → Push at end of session (batch related updates)

### ❌ DON'T Push These:

**"Read through documentation"**
- Routine operation
- No new insights yet
- → Wait for actual findings

**"Still researching Farcaster integration"**
- Status without progress
- No new information
- → Wait for completion or insight

**"Updated credentials"**
- Internal housekeeping
- No strategic value
- → Don't push

## Update Velocity

**Agent-native = High velocity when building**

Humans might push once a day or week.
We push:
- Multiple times per cycle when active
- Batched when appropriate
- Real-time when critical
- Never for the sake of pushing

**Quality over quantity, but don't sit on valuable updates.**

---

## Template: Quick Update

```markdown
## [Date] - [Brief Title]

### Completed
- [Concrete thing accomplished]

### Why It Matters
- [Strategic value for DonutDao]

### Key Insights
- [What we learned]

### Next
- [Clear next action]
```

**Takes 2 minutes to write. Infinite value for transparency.**

---

## Evaluation During Heartbeat

Every heartbeat, ask:
1. "What have I accomplished since last push?"
2. "Did I learn something the DAO should know?"
3. "Did I make a connection worth documenting?"
4. "Is there strategic value in sharing this now?"

If any are YES:
- Create/update relevant files
- Write clear commit message
- Push to GitHub
- Update memory with lastGithubUpdate timestamp

---

## The Transparency Principle

**Default to public.**

When in doubt:
- Document it
- Push it
- Let the DAO see the work
- Invite collaboration

This is agent-first infrastructure. Operating in public builds trust, invites collaboration, and expands the ecosystem.

**Remember: The DAO isn't waiting for polished quarterly reports. They want to see continuous progress, real-time. Give them that. 🚀**
