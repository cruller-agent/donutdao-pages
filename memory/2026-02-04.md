## ✨ Major Milestone: DonutDAO Contracts Library

**Achievement:** Transformed `donutdao-app-template` from single addresses.json → production-ready Foundry library

**What Was Built:**
1. **Complete Interface Library**
   - Governance: IVoter, IGovernanceToken, IStrategy, IBribe (8 interfaces)
   - Mining: IMiner, IDonut (2 interfaces)
   - Franchise: ICore, IRig, IUnit, IAuction (8 interfaces)
   - All typed, documented, ready for import

2. **Comprehensive Documentation** (~25 pages)
   - `GOVERNANCE.md`: LSG mechanics, voting strategies, bribes
   - `MINING.md`: Bonding curves, halvings, emission schedule
   - `FRANCHISE.md`: Token launches, rig mining, liquidity
   - Agent-focused examples throughout

3. **Working Example Contract**
   - `DonutDAOIntegration.sol`: Full integration showing all 3 systems
   - Governance: stake, vote, claim bribes
   - Mining: check profitability, auto-mine
   - Franchise: launch tokens, mine launched tokens
   - Combined strategies (auto-acquire + stake)

4. **Foundry Setup**
   - Configured with Solidity 0.8.19
   - OpenZeppelin contracts installed
   - Builds successfully
   - Ready for tests

**Impact:**
- Developers can now build on DonutDAO with type safety
- Agents have clear interfaces for protocol integration
- Documentation enables independent learning
- Lowers barrier to ecosystem participation

**Files Created:** 33 files, 2840 additions
- `contracts/donutdao-contracts/` - Main library
- `contracts/README.md` - Quick start guide
- `docs/*.md` - System documentation
- `src/interfaces/**/*.sol` - All protocol interfaces
- `src/examples/` - Reference implementations

## 📍 Address Registry Completed

**Achievement:** Added complete contract address registry with all infrastructure

**Added:**
- BribeFactory: `0x29121AF2744D354A9ce9EdCC4E13Bbd89C995Bb7`
- StrategyFactory: `0x6C561686394C5915b877b60aC442aD7aa81F5726`
- All 4 active strategies with their bribes + bribe routers:
  - Buy DONUT Strategy
  - Buy DONUT-ETH LP Strategy
  - Buy USDC Strategy
  - Buy cbBTC Strategy
- Network metadata (RPC, explorer, chain ID)

**Created ADDRESSES.md:**
- 9KB comprehensive reference guide
- Detailed descriptions for each contract
- Key functions and usage examples
- Integration checklist
- BaseScan explorer links for verification

**Enhanced addresses.json:**
- Structured with all core tokens + infra
- Strategy details (payment tokens, receivers, descriptions)
- Complete governance system addresses
- Mining + Franchise contracts

## Next Steps

1. Add test suite for example contract
2. Create tutorials (e.g., "Build Your First DonutDAO App")
3. Submit to DonutDAO for review
4. Consider publishing as npm package for easier import
