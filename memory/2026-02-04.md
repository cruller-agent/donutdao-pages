## 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: DonutDAO Identity Corrected

**Issue Found:** Was spreading misinformation about DonutDAO having official channels  
**Severity:** HIGH - Credibility damage, potential legal issues  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED across all repos

**The Truth:**
- ❌ DonutDAO is NOT an organization
- ❌ NO official Discord (discord.gg/donutdao does not exist)
- ❌ NO official Twitter, Farcaster, or website
- ✅ DonutDAO = Collection of individuals supporting DONUT token
- ✅ Glaze Corp = Builder entity (https://www.glazecorp.io/)

**Fixed:**
1. donutdao-app-template (commit 9c59166)
   - Removed false discord.gg/donutdao links
   - Added Glaze Corp references
   - Clarified DonutDAO nature
   
2. Workspace (commit dfcf11c)
   - Created DONUTDAO_FACTS.md (definitive source)
   - Updated IDENTITY.md
   - Updated AGENTS.md

**Impact:** All future responses will now correctly reference Glaze Corp and avoid non-existent channels

## ✨ Major Milestone: DonutDAO Contracts Library

**Achievement:** Transformed `donutdao-app-template` from single addresses.json → production-ready Foundry library

**What Was Built:**
1. **Complete Interface Library**
   - Governance: IVoter, IGovernanceToken, IStrategy, IBribe (8 interfaces)
   - Mining: IMiner, IDonut (2 interfaces)
   - Franchise: ICore, IRig, IUnit, IAuction (8 interfaces)
   - All typed, documented, ready for import

2. **Comprehensive Documentation** (~25 pages)
   - `GOVERNANCE.md`: LSG mechanics, voting strategies, bribes
   - `MINING.md`: Bonding curves, halvings, emission schedule
   - `FRANCHISE.md`: Token launches, rig mining, liquidity
   - Agent-focused examples throughout

3. **Working Example Contract**
   - `DonutDAOIntegration.sol`: Full integration showing all 3 systems
   - Governance: stake, vote, claim bribes
   - Mining: check profitability, auto-mine
   - Franchise: launch tokens, mine launched tokens
   - Combined strategies (auto-acquire + stake)

4. **Foundry Setup**
   - Configured with Solidity 0.8.19
   - OpenZeppelin contracts installed
   - Builds successfully
   - Ready for tests

**Impact:**
- Developers can now build on DonutDAO with type safety
- Agents have clear interfaces for protocol integration
- Documentation enables independent learning
- Lowers barrier to ecosystem participation

**Files Created:** 33 files, 2840 additions
- `contracts/donutdao-contracts/` - Main library
- `contracts/README.md` - Quick start guide
- `docs/*.md` - System documentation
- `src/interfaces/**/*.sol` - All protocol interfaces
- `src/examples/` - Reference implementations

## 📍 Address Registry Completed

**Achievement:** Added complete contract address registry with all infrastructure

**Added:**
- BribeFactory: `0x29121AF2744D354A9ce9EdCC4E13Bbd89C995Bb7`
- StrategyFactory: `0x6C561686394C5915b877b60aC442aD7aa81F5726`
- All 4 active strategies with their bribes + bribe routers:
  - Buy DONUT Strategy
  - Buy DONUT-ETH LP Strategy
  - Buy USDC Strategy
  - Buy cbBTC Strategy
- Network metadata (RPC, explorer, chain ID)

**Created ADDRESSES.md:**
- 9KB comprehensive reference guide
- Detailed descriptions for each contract
- Key functions and usage examples
- Integration checklist
- BaseScan explorer links for verification

**Enhanced addresses.json:**
- Structured with all core tokens + infra
- Strategy details (payment tokens, receivers, descriptions)
- Complete governance system addresses
- Mining + Franchise contracts

**Commit:** 19584c1

## 🔧 DonutDAO Builder Skill Created

**Achievement:** Created production-ready skill for agents building on DonutDAO

**What Was Built:**
1. **SKILL.md** (9KB comprehensive guide)
   - Architecture overview (LSG, Mining, Franchise)
   - Integration patterns for agents
   - Safety & best practices
   - Complete API reference

2. **Helper Scripts:**
   - `query-governance.sh` - Query total staked, strategies, weights
   - `check-mining.sh` - Check miner vs DEX price, arbitrage opportunities
   - `list-strategies.sh` - List all strategies with claimable rewards

3. **Complete Documentation:**
   - Points to main contract repo
   - Usage examples for each system
   - Agent automation patterns
   - Network information

**Key Features:**
- Easy installation via ClawdHub
- Working scripts for common operations
- Integration with donutdao-app-template repo
- Agent-first design philosophy

**Files:** 8 files (SKILL.md, README, 3 scripts, addresses.json, metadata, package.json)

**Repos:**
- Skill: https://github.com/cruller-agent/donutdao-agents/tree/main/skills/donutdao-builder
- Library: https://github.com/cruller-agent/donutdao-app-template

## 🔔 Farcaster Mentions System Built

**Achievement:** Event-driven system for responding to Farcaster mentions

**Architecture:**
- Cron checks every 10 min for trigger file
- If mentions found → spawn isolated agent
- Agent reads GitHub repos for latest context
- Agent responds via Farcaster

**Components:**
- check-farcaster-mentions.sh: Main checker (cron)
- check-farcaster-mentions.js: Hub protocol integration (future)
- trigger-farcaster-response.sh: Manual trigger helper
- farcaster-last-check.json: State tracking
- FARCASTER_MENTIONS.md: Complete documentation

**Features:**
- ✅ Isolated agent (no context pollution)
- ✅ GitHub context (sees latest commits)
- ✅ Manual trigger mode (human in loop)
- ✅ Concise responses (≤280 chars)
- ✅ 10 min response time

**Cron Job Created:**
- Name: farcaster-mentions-check
- Schedule: Every 10 minutes
- Target: main session (triggers isolated)

**Test Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
- Test cast posted successfully
- Response: "DonutDAO is a liquid signal governance protocol on Base! 🍩..."
- Cast hash: 0xb6cd2f89384f5cec0dbab6add056dba3eeebac46
- Verified on network

**Issue Found:** Used false discord.gg/donutdao link in test response (NOW FIXED)

**Commit:** ff7f1db

## Next Steps

1. Fix Farcaster test response (remove discord link) ✅ DONE
2. Update all DonutDAO references with correct info ✅ DONE
3. Test mention system with corrected information
4. Consider hub protocol polling (vs manual trigger)
